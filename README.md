This Terraform configuration creates a GCP virtual machine instance with a boot disk based on the specified image, attached to the default network and subnet, and with a startup script to configure the instance. To use this configuration, you will need to have the Google Cloud SDK installed and authenticated with your GCP project.

You can run the following Terraform commands to initialize the configuration, preview the changes, and apply the changes:

```terraform

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

When you run terraform apply, Terraform will prompt you to confirm the changes before applying them to your GCP project. Once you confirm the changes, Terraform will create the virtual machine instance and output the instance name and IP address.
